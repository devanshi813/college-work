## Implementaion Details
After installation of the app as a new user the app take on the login page where it will ask Mobile number and identity proof of the user once successful login. It will take you to the next page named as consent form where you need to put your other details such as address, details of the person you want to contact during emergency and a check statement stating not to do the fake use of the application. Then the app will ask the permissions to allow Camera ,voice recorder and GPS when you open the application.

So  when the user will use the application after the filling of details, it will ask how to help. If its emergency the user can press the panic button and immediately the app will start the camera, voice and gps and connect to the nearest police station in the real time and also send a sos message to contact provided and if there is no network at the user end the app will send a sos message and location to the police . If there is no such urgency and still user find unsafe they can opt for prioritized taxi service at higher price.
